    # Harmonica tabs are 99% useless without an audio guide.
    # An audio guide is not an enjoyable musical composition, but rather
    # a minimum informative representation of the song, which provides more
    # context to the corresponding haromnica tab and allows the user
    # to adjust individual notes to their liking.
    # Therefore using audio guides in rendered audio form, rather then
    # in midi-like format, is a waste of space, waste of resources
    # and loss of important functionality.
    
    # Not all platforms have convenient midi libraries. Additionally,
    # selective playback of midi notes according to a list of known
    # timecodes is a complex and bug-prone endeavor. In order
    # to enable efficient fragment extraction and easy debugging,
    # it makes sense to sketch the core logic using some
    # easy-to-parse temporary format with fixed timestamps,
    # rather then actual midi with relative deltaTime and SetTempoEvents.
    
    # This static interface converts `.mid` files into minimal `.csv` files,
    # with sole purpose to accelerate critical code design / debug final
    # midi parsers.
