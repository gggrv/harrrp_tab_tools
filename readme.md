# [harrrp] Core

| Item | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| What is this? | Critical part of project `harrrp`, several `python` interfaces and tools for `.yaml` harmonica tabs. |
| What does it contain?<br><sub>Not a complete list, please see further sections.</sub> | <ul><li>Python `interfaces` to all historical `harrrp` `harmonica tab schema versions`, starting from minimum version `4.1.0`.</li><li>Tab difficulty estimator.</li><li>`index.csv` creator.</li></ul> |
| What does it NOT contain? | <ul><li>Batch tab editor.</li><li>Tab creator.</li></ul> |
| Why does it NOT contain some items? | Because the items in question are abstract programmatic text-editing tools, which are not unique nor native to project harrrp ‚Äî they belong to a different project. |

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

Since the tools in this repository are targeted towards batch non-editing operations on already existing harmonica tabs, the first step requires the user to actually provide the paths to his already existing harmonica tabs.

### Define paths

Paths to existing harmonica tabs are defined using the `tab_folders.txt` file, located at the root of the project. The example contents could be as follows:
```
some/custom/path/tabs
c:\another\custom\path\tabs

d:\third\different\location\tabs
```

### Run some tool

After defining paths to at least one existing folder with harmonica tabs, `tool launchers` become usable.

Please choose the `autorun_*.py` file according to current goals, open it with IDE of choice and run it.

## Structure

### Overall

The project contains several parts that nicely fit together and allow to easily accomodate future changes while preserving past versions and functionality.

### Individual Parts

| Name | Description | How to Locate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Some `tool` | Rather abstract data analysis tool that can be applied to any compatible user input, regardless of its origin or meaning.<br><sub>There can be many of them, they exist for different purposes.</sub> | Any file named `src/some_*_Columns`. |
| Some `tool launcher` | Wapper code that allows the user to one-click apply the `tool` of choice to any `harrrp` harmonica tabs without headaches or low-level considerations.<br><sub>There can be many of them, they exist for usage convenience.</sub> | Any file named `autorun_*.py`. |
| Some `interface` to specific `harmonica tab schema version` | Actual low-level programmatic `interface` to some specific `harrrp` harmonica tab.<br><sub>There are many of them, they evolve according to user needs.</sub> | Any file named `src/format_*/Columns_Tab.py`. |
| The `interface chooser` | One convenient endpoint that automatically chooses the correct programmatic `interface` for any given harmonica tab, freeing the developer from any worries regarding "how to process this specific tab".<br><sub>There is only one.</sub> | The file named `src/some_TabFormat_Columns.py`. |

### How They Communicate

|  | Some `tool` | Some `interface` to specific `harmonica tab schema version` | The `interface chooser` | Some `tool launcher` |

## Available Functionality

In this section the functionality of all available "some `tools`" and "some `tool launchers`" is listed.

| Tool | Description | How to Locate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Estimate tab difficulty. | <ul><li>Analyze given input (that usually represents notes within some harmonica tab) and determine its actual real-life performance difficulty using sensible multifactor scoring system.</li><li>Calculate the most optimal default sorting order (easiest ‚Üí hardest) based on the assumption that the player is capable of consistently producing single notes.</li></ul> | <p>The file named `src/some_Difficulty_Columns.py`.</p><p>The file named `autorun_IndexCsv.py`.</p> |
| Create convenient tab comparison table. | <ul><li>Provide quick overview of all harmonica tabs in specific user-defined root folder.</li><li>Allow applications to access critical metadata regarding harmonica tabs without actually parsing them. </li><li>Automatically calculate and save tab difficulty scores for future use.</li></ul> | <p>The file named `src/some_IndexCsv_Columns.py`.</p><p>The file named `autorun_IndexCsv.py`.</p> |
| Process `.midi` attachments. | <ul><li>Embed externally-created timecodes into the actual harmonica tab so that the apps know which part of `.midi` to playback for any given line.</li><li>Temporarily convert `.midi` data to simplified debug `.csv` with absolute timecodes so that app development becomes easier.</li><li>Force all `.midi` files to comply with the `MIDI Type 1` standard so that any application can reliably calculate correct timecodes.</li></ul> | <p>The file named `src/some_MidiText_Columns.py`.</p><p>The file named `autorun_MidiCsv.py`.</p><p>The file named `autorun_MidiType1Force.py`.</p><p>The file named `autorun_PasteTimecodes.py`.</p> |
